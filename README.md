Scraping the incident behind each 2022 Small Business Administration disaster loan from the Federal Register
For this assignment, I downloaded disaster loan data from the Small Business Association website. 
The available data gave a disaster loan ID, but no description of the "disaster" that the loan was covering. 
The Federal Register offers short descriptions of each ID through the search function on its website. With each unique ID from the SBA data, I scraped the Federal Register site to pull that description. 
Now I have the reason behind each loan and can apply that context when looking for trends in weather data for different states. I also will be able to quantify how much money the Small Business Association is allocating for different types of disasters in 2022.
